# karbonize - Decentralized Personal Carbon Trading

The POC for Karbonize includes a mobile application where the users can register their accounts and based on some initial questions, they'll will be given a weekly carbon emission allowance for travel. This is based on the same model as implemented by [Lahti, Finland](https://carbonwatchdog.org/lahti-finland-carbon-rationing/)

When the app is given location permissions, it runs a ML model to determine the mode of transport for users and deduct the Karbon Kredits(weekly carbon emission quota). This credit management is done on the blockchain for verified user accounts.

The users can also trade their Karbon Kredits and all the trade transactions execute on the blockchain.
